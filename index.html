      <h2>What are Greenhouse Gases?</h2>
      <p>The release of greenhouse gases associated with human activities and climate change is referred to as
        greenhouse gas emissions, or climate pollution. And since the start of the Industrial Revolution and the advent
        of coal-powered steam engines, human activities have supersized the volume of greenhouse gases emitted into the
        atmosphere. It is estimated that between 1750 and 2019, atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide increased
        by 47 percent, methane by 156 percent, and nitrous oxide by 23 percent. In the late 1920s, we started adding
        man-made fluorinated gases like chlorofluorocarbons to the mix.<br><br>

        In recent decades, we’ve only picked up the pace. Of all the human-driven emissions of carbon dioxide,
        approximately half were generated in the last 30 years alone. And while global greenhouse gas emissions have
        occasionally plateaued or dropped from year to year (most recently at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, as the
        pause in global travel and manufacturing dropped carbon dioxide emissions almost 6 percent), they’re
        accelerating once again.<br><br></p>

      <h2>Greenhouse gases and the greenhouse effect</h2>
      <p>The gases act like the glass walls of a greenhouse – hence the name, greenhouse gases. Without this greenhouse
        effect, temperatures would drop to as low as -18˚C (-0.4˚F); too cold to sustain life on earth.<br><br>

        But human activities are changing earth's natural greenhouse effect with a dramatic increase in the release of
        greenhouse gases. Scientists agree greenhouse gases are the cause of global warming and climate change.<br><br>

        Since the Industrial Revolution, humans have been releasing larger quantities of greenhouse gases into the
        atmosphere. In the past century that amount has increased dramatically, with the knock-on effect of global
        warming. Global temperatures have accelerated in the past 30 years and are now the highest since records
        began.<br><br>

      <h2>The Consequences of the Greenhouse Effect?</h2>
      <p>Today, concentrations of human-caused greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are higher than ever and the planet is
        heating up. Between preindustrial times and now, the earth’s average temperature has increased almost 2 degrees
        Fahrenheit (1.1 degree Celsius), with two-thirds of that warming occurring in the last handful of decades
        alone.<br><br>

        According to the IPCC, the world can emit a total of just 400 billion tonnes more of carbon dioxide, measured
        from the start of 2020, if we want at least a 50 percent chance of staying below the critical threshold of 1.5
        degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming. At our current pace, the world will blow its entire “carbon
        budget” by around 2030.<br><br>

        Driven by the burning of fossil fuels, global warming is altering the earth’s climate systems in many ways, such
        as:<br><br>

        Causing more frequent and/or intense extreme weather events, including heat waves, hurricanes, droughts, and
        floods.<br>
        Exacerbating precipitation extremes, making wet regions wetter and dry regions drier.
        Raising sea levels, due to melting ice sheets and glaciers and an increase in ocean temperatures (warmer water
        expands, which can contribute to sea level rise).<br>
        Altering ecosystems and natural habitats; shifting animals’ geographic ranges, seasonal activities, and
        migration patterns.<br>
        Climate change impacts where we can live, how we work, how we grow our food—especially if we live or work in
        frontline communities. Warmer temperatures mean more insects that spread diseases like dengue fever—and heat
        waves are getting hotter and becoming more lethal to humans. Climate change-driven droughts and floods also pose
        huge risks to agriculture. Research suggests that for every degree Celsius that the planet heats up, crop yields
        will go down 3 to 7 percent. Food insecurity can lead to mass human migration and political instability in
        regions all over the world.<br><br>

      <h2>What are the main greenhouse gases?</h2>
      <img

        alt="" style="width:50%; height: 10%;">
      <p><b>Carbon dioxide (CO2)</b><br><br>
        CO2 is released through natural processes, such as volcanic eruptions, plant respiration and animals and humans
        breathing. But the atmospheric CO2 concentration has increased by 50% since the Industrial Revolution began in
        the 1800s, due to human activities like the burning of fossil fuels and large-scale deforestation. Due to its
        abundance, CO2 is the main contributor to climate change.<br><br>


        <b>Methane</b><br><br>
        Methane is produced naturally through decomposition. But again, human activity has displaced the natural
        balance. Large amounts of methane are released by cattle farming, landfill waste dumps, rice farming and the
        traditional production of oil and gas.<br><br>


        <b>Nitrous oxide</b><br><br>
        Nitrous oxide is produced through the large-scale use of commercial and organic fertilisers, fossil-fuel
        combustion, nitric-acid production and biomass burning.<br><br>


        <b>Water vapour</b><br><br>
        Water vapour is the most abundant greenhouse gas. It increases as the earth's atmosphere warms but unlike CO2,
        which can remain in the earth’s atmosphere for centuries, water vapour persists for a few days.<br><br>


        <b>Natural and man-made GHGs</b><br><br>
        The group of gases detailed above are naturally produced, but their increasing atmospheric concentration is
        man-made.<br><br>

        In contrast, the three industrial fluorinated gases – hydrofluorocarbons (HFC), perfluorocarbons (PFC) and
        sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) – are solely man-made during industrial processes and do not occur in nature. Though
        they are present in very small concentrations in the atmosphere, they trap heat very effectively, meaning they
        are extremely potent.
        <br><br>
        SF6, which is used in high-voltage electricity equipment, has a ‘Global Warming Potential’ 23,000 times greater
        than CO2.<br><br>

    <section id="reduce">
      <h2>What can be done to reduce greenhouse gases?</h2>
      <p>The earth has always experienced warm and cool phases, with natural forces—from the sun’s intensity, volcanic
        eruptions, and natural changes in greenhouse gas concentrations—affecting how much energy from the sun our
        planet absorbs. As recently as a couple of centuries ago, the planet underwent a “Little Ice Age,” caused by a
        decrease in solar activity and an increase in volcanic activity. But today’s warming—particularly the increase
        in temperatures since the mid-20th century—is occurring at a pace that can’t be explained by natural causes
        alone.<br><br>

        The good news is that we have the ability to rein in runaway greenhouse gas emissions. But overhauling our
        energy systems will require transformative, aggressive global action—right now. According to the IPCC, we must
        halve greenhouse gas pollution by 2030 and reach net-zero emissions by 2050.<br><br>

        Reducing our greenhouse gas emissions will require significant effort at the international, national, and local
        levels. First and foremost, we must slash fossil fuel production, consumption, and pollution by ramping up our
        use of clean, renewable energy and energy-efficient technologies and by investing in fuel-efficient and electric
        vehicles.<br><br>

        We must end fossil fuel subsidies and better leverage investments, like those in the Inflation Reduction Act, to
        target clean energy technology and accessibility while reducing household energy bills, creating jobs, and
        protecting our health and environment. We must protect our carbon-storing forests and reduce food waste and the
        emissions that go with it. We should be doubling down on reducing emissions from dirty power plants and cars and
        trucks. And as individuals, we must commit to taking carbon-cutting actions in our daily lives.<br><br>

        It’s clear that decision makers, companies, leaders, and activists across the country and around the world
        staunchly believe we must all act on climate change. For just as the greenhouse gas emissions from a century ago
        are inducing the climate change we see now, the emissions we release today will impact us long into the
        future.<br><br></p>

      <h2>What are we doing to reduce greenhouse gases at National Grid?</h2>
      <p>We are committed to achieving net zero by 2050. Helping society to decarbonise is the biggest contribution we
        can make to the environment.<br><br>

        This means working towards the connection of low-carbon, renewable energy sources across the India, and
        achieving the technical capability of operating a zero-carbon electricity system.<br><br>

        We're proud of what we've achieved to date, but there is much more we can do. We believe we have a
        responsibility to lead the way and help drive emissions down across the energy sector and have a strategy to do
        this.<br><br>

        Our Climate Transition Plan outlines some of the key near-term actions we're undertaking to reach our GHG
        reduction targets. For example:<br><br></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          We're planning to halve emissions across the Group by 2030 (from 2016) and reduce them to zero by 2050,
          limiting our use of external offsets to get there.<br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
          We're reducing SF6 emissions from our global operation by 50% by 2030, through leak identification and repair,
          as well as investment in SF6 alternatives.<br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
          We'll continue to efficiently connect renewables and to build interconnectors, supporting wider
          decarbonisation of electricity markets.<br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
          We'll continue to grow our renewable generation business in the US over the coming decade, which will
          significantly lower the overall intensity of our generation portfolio.<br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
          We'll move to a 100% electric fleet by 2030 for our light-duty vehicles.<br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
          We'll continue innovation in nation-leading energy efficiency programmes for our customers.<br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
          We'll invest in network modernisation to reduce fugitive natural gas emissions and increase safety and
          reliability.<br><br>
        </li>
